## 📊 **CURRENT EXTRACTION STATUS**

### **Best Achieved Parameters**
```
Image: top row.png (cropped from poster)
Location: y=21, x=0
Spacing: 17 pixels
Threshold: V-channel > 90
Accuracy: 62.5% match with manual reading
```

### **Target vs Extracted Comparison**
```
Target (manual):    010011110110111000100000011101000110100001100101
Best extraction:    000000100000000000100000000011000100000001000110
Accuracy:           62.5% (30/48 bits correct)
```

### **Key Insights**
- **V-channel analysis**: 1s have V~101-102, 0s have V~14-30
- **Spatial alignment**: Text located around y=21 in 57-pixel-high crop
- **Spacing confirmation**: 17-pixel spacing shows best correlation
- **Threshold needs adjustment**: Current 90 threshold suboptimal

---

## 🔍 **TECHNICAL CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED**

### **1. Threshold Optimization**
- **Current issue**: V=90 threshold misses many 1s (V~101)
- **Solution needed**: Adjust to V~80-85 for better 1/0 separation
- **Impact**: Should improve from 62.5% to target >90% accuracy

### **2. Spatial Alignment**
- **Current issue**: May not be sampling exact glyph centers
- **Progress**: Located general region (y=21) but needs fine-tuning
- **User guidance**: Provided glyph dimensions (12x16px, 19px spacing)

### **3. Background vs Foreground**
- **Current issue**: Distinguishing cyan glyphs from dark background
- **Analysis**: Clear separation exists (V~101 vs V~30)
- **Refinement needed**: Optimize sampling coordinates and method

---

## 📋 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **High Priority**
1. **Adjust threshold to V~80-85** based on observed value separation
2. **Fine-tune sampling coordinates** using user's glyph dimension specs
3. **Validate on full 48-bit sequence** to confirm "On the " extraction
4. **Extract extended line** once accuracy >90% achieved

### **Parameters to Test**
```
Threshold: V > 80 (instead of 90)
Sampling: Center of 12x16px glyphs with 19px spacing
Y-position: Fine-tune around y=21 for optimal glyph capture
X-start: Verify alignment with first glyph
```
