## üîÑ Coordination Protocol

### 1. Communication
- **Status Updates**: Update `project_status.json` after major changes
- **Documentation**: Use markdown files for sharing findings
- **Code Comments**: Clear documentation of algorithm changes
- **Exhaustive Logging**: Every agent must log all changes, techniques, research needs, setbacks, breakthroughs, and relevant context in markdown/status files. This is mandatory for both phase 1 (accurate extraction) and phase 2 (data meaning).

### 2. File Management
- **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names with agent prefix
  - `cursor_visual_tools.py`
  - `claude_analysis_report.md`
  - `codex_grid_detection.py`
- **Output Structure**: 
  ```
  test_results/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cursor_validation/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ claude_analysis/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ codex_optimization/
  ```

### 3. Version Control
- **Branching**: Each agent works on separate features
- **Commits**: Include agent name and brief description
- **Merging**: Coordinate through main integration

### 4. Lightweight Conflict Avoidance Practices
- **Announce file/feature work:** Agents should note in `project_status.json` (or a shared log) when they begin work on a file or feature that might overlap with others.
- **Prefer separate modules:** When possible, agents should work on different modules, scripts, or config sections to minimize overlap.
- **Check for recent changes:** Before starting major edits, agents should pull the latest changes from `main` and review recent commits/PRs in other agent branches.
- **Early communication:** If overlap is likely, agents should communicate and coordinate early to avoid unnecessary conflicts.
- **Keep it simple:** These practices are meant to be lightweight and practical, not burdensome‚Äîaimed at reducing merge conflicts while maintaining rapid iteration.

## üìù Notes for Success

1. **Start Small**: Test on 5x5 grid region first
2. **Validate Early**: Check accuracy before expanding
3. **Document Everything**: Track what works and what doesn't
4. **Coordinate Often**: Share findings regularly
5. **Be Honest**: Acknowledge failures and limitations
6. **Maintain exhaustive, transparent logs and documentation at every step.**

Remember: The goal is accuracy, not speed. Better to have 100 correctly extracted bits than 1000 incorrect ones.
