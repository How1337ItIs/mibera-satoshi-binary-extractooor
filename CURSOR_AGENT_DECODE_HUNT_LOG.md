# CURSOR AGENT: DECODE HUNT LOG
**Date:** July 16, 2025  
**Phase:** Binary Decoding & Pattern Search  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

---

## üìã **CONTEXT & RATIONALE**

- **Objective:** Exhaustively search the validated 1,440-bit stream for any decodable payloads, hidden keys, or meaningful patterns using a methodical, multi-step approach.
- **Why:** The bitstream is 100% coverage, validated, and has a highly structured ratio (75.6% zeros, 24.4% ones), suggesting possible padding or encoding rather than pure randomness.
- **Strategy:** Try all low-hanging fruit (ASCII, base encodings, WIF, QR, etc.) before moving to deeper crypto-statistical analysis.

## üïê **TIMELINE OF ACTIONS**

### **[17:00] - Plan & Tooling**
- User provided a detailed, stepwise plan for binary decoding and pattern search.
- Steps include: byte splits, bit shifts, reverse bit order, endianness swaps, base64/base58 scans, WIF brute, QR matrix, entropy monitoring.
- Stub code and logging/artefact plan provided.

### **[17:05] - Tool Implementation**
- Created `scripts/decode_hunt.py` implementing all steps:
  1. Canonical byte split
  2. All 8 bit-shifts
  3. Reverse bit order per byte
  4. Endianness swaps
  5. Base64/Base58 window scan
  6. WIF/key prefix brute force
  7. QR-matrix guess
  8. Entropy drop monitoring
- Logging to `decode_attempts.log`, results to `candidate_hits.csv`, `decode_attempts.json`, and `decode_heatmap.png`.
- Updated `requirements.txt` for all dependencies.

### **[17:10] - First Run**
- Ran `python scripts/decode_hunt.py`.
- All steps executed; logging and heatmap generated.
- **WIF CANDIDATES** detected at several offsets (e.g., 312, 488, 536, 808, 848, 1008) with hex data starting with `0x80...`.
- QR matrix attempts for 37x37, 29x29, 25x25, 21x21 (black ratios: 0.247‚Äì0.463).
- No clear ASCII or base64/base58 hits.
- **Error:** CSV serialization failed due to non-serializable fields (`matrix`, `matrix_size`, `black_ratio`).

### **[17:15] - Bugfix Attempt**
- Patched `save_results()` to filter out non-serializable fields for CSV.
- Re-ran script; still failed due to additional fields (`black_ratio`, `matrix_size`).
- **Root Cause:** QR matrix results include fields not present in other candidate dicts, causing CSV field mismatch.

## üìù **RESULTS & FINDINGS**

- **WIF Candidates:** Multiple offsets flagged as possible WIF (Wallet Import Format) private key candidates, all with version byte 0x80. No valid base58check or printable key detected yet.
- **QR Matrix:** No QR code detected, but black/white ratios logged for several plausible sizes.
- **ASCII/Base64/Base58:** No obvious hits; no long printable strings or known Bitcoin phrases found.
- **Entropy Monitoring:** Heatmap generated (`decode_heatmap.png`), no dramatic entropy dips observed.
- **Artefacts Generated:**
  - `decode_attempts.log` (full log of all decode attempts)
  - `decode_heatmap.png` (offset vs printable-ratio/entropy)
  - `candidate_hits.csv` (failed to write due to serialization bug)
  - `decode_attempts.json` (all decode attempts, not yet verified)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **ISSUES ENCOUNTERED**

- **CSV Serialization Error:**
  - Non-uniform candidate dicts (QR matrix results have extra fields).
  - Solution: Filter all candidate dicts to a common set of fields before writing CSV.
- **No Decoding Hits Yet:**
  - No ASCII, base64, or base58 decodes yielded long printable strings or known phrases.
  - WIF candidates detected, but not validated as real keys.

---

## üìà **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Fix CSV Serialization:**
   - Ensure all candidate dicts have a uniform set of fields for CSV output.
   - Optionally, split QR matrix results into a separate file.
2. **Review WIF Candidates:**
   - Check if any flagged WIF candidates are valid base58check keys.
   - Attempt to decode/validate as Bitcoin private keys.
3. **Review Artefacts:**
   - Examine `decode_heatmap.png` for any entropy dips or printable ratio spikes.
   - Inspect `decode_attempts.log` for any overlooked hits.
4. **If No Hits:**
   - Move to Direction #2: deeper crypto-statistical/randomness analysis.

## üö¶ **SUCCESS CRITERIA (RECAP)**
- Any decoded string ‚â•‚ÄØ20 printable chars
- Any valid Base58Check payload (checksum passes)
- Entropy dip ‚â•‚ÄØ0.2‚ÄØbits between raw bytes and decoded/pruned bytes
