# TODO Completion Log: bw_mask.png Regression Test

## TODO Completed
- **Task:** Add regression test that hashes bw_mask.png to catch silent morphology/thresholding regressions.
- **Status:** Completed

## Rationale
- Silent changes in image processing can break extraction quality without obvious errors. Hashing the output mask and comparing to a reference hash provides a robust regression test.

## Implementation
- Created `test_bw_mask_regression.py` to compute and compare the SHA-256 hash of `test_results/bw_mask.png`.
- Reference hash is stored in `test_results/bw_mask_reference_hash.txt`.
- Script prints instructions to set the reference hash if missing, and reports pass/fail on comparison.

## Impact
- Enables early detection of silent regressions in the pipeline.
- Improves reproducibility and confidence in extraction results.
- Can be integrated into CI or pre-merge checks.
