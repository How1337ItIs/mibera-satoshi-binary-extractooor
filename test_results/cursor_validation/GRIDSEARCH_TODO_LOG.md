## TODO Completed
- **Task:** Write scripts/gridsearch.py for auto-hyperparam grid search over blur_sigma, bit_hi/lo, color spaces, and threshold methods. Score by F1 and printable ASCII ratio.
- **Status:** Completed

## Rationale
- Manual parameter tuning is slow and error-prone. Automated grid search enables systematic exploration of the parameter space, revealing optimal settings and interactions.

## Implementation
- Created `scripts/gridsearch.py` to iterate over combinations of blur_sigma, bit_hi, bit_lo, color_space, and threshold method.
- For each combination, runs the extraction pipeline, scores results by F1 (if reference available) and printable ASCII ratio, and logs results to a CSV summary.
- Prints progress and results for each run.

## Usage
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed and the pipeline is runnable.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python scripts/gridsearch.py
   ```
3. Review results in `test_results/gridsearch_results.csv`.

## Impact
- Enables rapid, reproducible parameter sweeps.
- Supports data-driven tuning and honest reporting of pipeline performance.
- Can be extended to include more parameters or scoring metrics as needed.
