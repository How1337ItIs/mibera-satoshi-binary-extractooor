# DEPRECATION NOTICE
**Date:** July 16, 2025  
**Reason:** Outdated approaches and data formats

---

## üìã **WHY THESE FILES WERE ARCHIVED**

These files were created during the initial phases of the Cursor Agent's work and are now **DEPRECATED** because they:

1. **Work with outdated data formats** - Use old extraction results instead of optimized data
2. **Employ superseded approaches** - Use inferior methods that were later improved
3. **Contain misleading information** - Show results from before the major optimization breakthrough
4. **Are no longer relevant** - Superseded by better tools and approaches

## üìÅ **ARCHIVED FILES**

### **Analysis Tools (DEPRECATED)**
- `cursor_extraction_analysis.py` - Old extraction analysis (superseded by optimization tools)
- `cursor_bit_bias_investigation.py` - Initial bias investigation (superseded by threshold optimizer)
- `cursor_visual_validation_corrected.py` - Old validation approach (superseded by new validation tools)
- `cursor_grid_calibration.py` - Old grid calibration (superseded by improved methods)

### **Data Files (DEPRECATED)**
- `cursor_analysis_report.json` - Old analysis results (before optimization)
- `cursor_calibration_log.json` - Old calibration data (before improvements)
- `cursor_validation_log.json` - Old validation results (before optimization)
- `cursor_validation_results.json` - Old validation data (before optimization)

### **Visual Files (DEPRECATED)**
- `cursor_validation_region_*.png` - Old validation images (before optimization)
- `cursor_validation_cell_*.png` - Old cell validation images (before optimization)

## ‚úÖ **CURRENT ACTIVE FILES**

### **Use These Instead:**
- `cursor_optimized_extraction.csv` - **CURRENT** optimized binary data (1,440 cells)
- `cursor_optimized_extraction.json` - **CURRENT** detailed optimized results
- `cursor_threshold_optimizer.py` - **CURRENT** threshold optimization tool
- `cursor_optimization_validation.py` - **CURRENT** comprehensive validation
- `cursor_simple_validation.py` - **CURRENT** rationality checks
- `cursor_quick_visual_check.py` - **CURRENT** visual verification
- `cursor_cryptographic_analysis.py` - **CURRENT** pattern analysis tool

### **Current Documentation:**
- `CURSOR_AGENT_COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION.md` - **CURRENT** comprehensive docs
- `CURSOR_AGENT_TIMESTAMPED_LOG.md` - **CURRENT** complete timeline
- `CURSOR_AGENT_FINAL_SUMMARY.md` - **CURRENT** final summary

---

## üîÑ **KEY IMPROVEMENTS MADE**

### **Before (Archived Files):**
- 524 cells with 93.5% ones vs 6.5% zeros (severe bias)
- 36.4% coverage of total cells
- Poor threshold discrimination
- Misleading validation results

### **After (Current Files):**
- 1,440 cells with 75.6% zeros vs 24.4% ones (much better balance)
- 100% coverage of total cells
- Optimal threshold 80 with perfect separation
- Comprehensive validation with all checks passed

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**

**DO NOT USE** any files in this archive for current analysis. They contain outdated information and inferior approaches that have been completely superseded by the optimized extraction results.

**ALWAYS USE** the current active files listed above for any analysis or validation work.
