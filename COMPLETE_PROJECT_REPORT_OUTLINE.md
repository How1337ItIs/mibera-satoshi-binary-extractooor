# Complete Project Report Outline

---

## 1. Executive Summary
- Brief overview of the projectâ€™s purpose, scope, and current status
- Key findings and honest assessment
- High-level summary of what has been accomplished and what remains

## 2. Project Goals and Philosophy
- Original motivation (extract every visible 0 and 1 from the Satoshi poster)
- Philosophy: maximize true bit extraction, not just match a reference
- Emphasis on reproducibility, configurability, and honest validation
- Research-driven, not just engineering

## 3. Codebase Structure and Agent Workflow
- Directory and file structure (main scripts, modules, data, tests, logs)
- Agent-based workflow: Cursor, Claude, Codex (roles, branches, responsibilities)
- Branching and PR protocol
- Logging and documentation standards (exhaustive, per-change, per-TODO)

## 4. Major Features, Experiments, and TODOs
- List and describe all major features implemented (grid detection, overlay mask, template matching, etc.)
- All significant experiments and parameter sweeps (grid search, threshold tuning, etc.)
- All TODOs attempted, completed, or abandoned (with rationale)
- Regression tests, validation tools, and automation

## 5. Research Conducted
- Grid calibration and brute-force search
- Overlay mask tuning and validation
- Bit threshold tuning and dual-pass logic
- Template matching and template extraction
- Grid search automation (parameter sweeps, scoring)
- Confusion matrix and validation framework
- Pattern analysis and cryptographic context
- Honest assessment and visual validation
- Documentation/logging research and protocol

## 6. Honest Assessment of Results and Limitations
- Summary of actual extraction accuracy (visual validation, not just pipeline claims)
- Known issues (grid alignment, overlay detection, ambiguous cells)
- Discrepancies between claimed and validated results
- Limitations of current methods and data
- Critical warnings and disclaimers

## 7. Documentation and Logging Practices
- Exhaustive logging protocol (per-change, per-TODO, per-experiment)
- Location and format of logs, reports, and status files
- How to interpret and extend the documentation

## 8. Lessons Learned and Setbacks
- Major obstacles encountered (e.g., grid misalignment, overconfident claims)
- Failed experiments and what was learned
- Adjustments to philosophy and workflow
- Importance of honest validation and reproducibility

## 9. Open Questions and Future Research Directions
- Unresolved issues (e.g., overlay brute-fill, CNN digit classifier, super-resolution)
- Areas for further research (pattern decoding, cryptographic analysis, entropy-guided methods)
- Suggestions for new experiments or methods
- How to contribute or extend the project

## 10. References and File Index
- List of all relevant scripts, logs, markdowns, and data files
- Branches and PRs of interest
- Where to find configuration, templates, and test data

## 11. Guidance for Future Agents and Researchers
- How to get started (setup, running the pipeline, validation)
- How to follow the logging/documentation protocol
- How to propose and document new research
- Best practices for reproducibility and honest reporting

## 12. Appendix / Additional Context
- Any other relevant details, context, or historical notes
- Links to external references, related projects, or foundational research
