# Archive Notice: Misleading Documentation

This directory contains documentation files that were created during the analysis but contain misleading claims that were later disproven by rigorous verification.

## Archival Date
2024-01-17

## Reason for Archival
These files contain unverified claims about "breakthroughs" and "100% pattern matching" that independent audit revealed to be artifacts or biased extractions.

## Key Issues Found
1. **Pattern Artifacts**: Claims of 100% pattern matching worked on shuffled random data
2. **Extraction Bias**: 28.9% ones ratio indicates systematic bias
3. **Hash Claims**: Cannot extract claimed 9 leading zeros hash at specified position
4. **Low Entropy**: 34.6% byte entropy vs claimed 56.2%

## Verification Status
- Independent audit: **QUESTIONABLE**
- Hash verification: **FAILED**
- Pattern validation: **ARTIFACTS DETECTED**

## Current Status
See `rigorous_verification.json` and `independent_audit_results.json` for actual verified results.

Alternative grid analysis has identified better extraction configurations with higher entropy and balanced ones ratios.
