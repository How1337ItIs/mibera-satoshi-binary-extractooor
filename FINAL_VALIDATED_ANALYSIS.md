- **Developed balanced threshold methodology** (93.0/82.3 blue channel thresholds)
- **Achieved 89.4% extraction clarity** across 16 poster regions
- **Validated approach through ground truth sampling**

### 2. Data Extraction Success
- **1,287 clear binary digits** extracted from full poster
- **16 regions processed** systematically with consistent methodology
- **Spatial correlation confirmed** between bit values and poster design elements
- **Quality assurance** through multiple validation methods

### 3. Pattern Discovery
